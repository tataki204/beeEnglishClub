# This code defines the URL patterns for the API, mapping the 'hello/' endpoint to the HelloView class.
# The HelloView class handles GET requests and returns a JSON response with a greeting message.
# The urlpatterns list is used by Django to route incoming requests to the appropriate view based on the URL path.
# The 'name' parameter allows for easy reference to this URL pattern in templates or    redirects.
# This setup is typical in Django REST Framework applications, where views are created to handle specific API
# endpoints, and URLs are defined to map those views to specific paths.
